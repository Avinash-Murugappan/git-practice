# HomeWork 1 :Git Practice

<b>Step 1:</b> Created GitHub Repo and cloned it <br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Created one.txt file and committed to the main branch <br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Created a new branch called branch -1 using `git branch branch-1` command <br>
<b>Step 4:</b> To check if the branch is created, I used the command `git branch -a` <br>
<b>Step 5:</b> Then I switched to branch-1 using `git checkout branch-1` command <br>
<b>Step 6:</b> I pushed the branch to remote using `git push origin branch-1` command <br>
<b>Step 7:</b> I created the two.txt file and made changes to one.txt in `branch-1` <br>
<b>Step 7:</b> Then I added, committed and pushed using `git push origin branch-1` command <br>
<b>Step 8:</b> I re based the branch-1 to master using `git rebase branch-1 main` command <br>
<b>Step 9:</b> I cross checked by using the `git log --graph --oneline` command <br>
<b>Step 10:</b> In this step, pushed the changes by using `git push origin main`
